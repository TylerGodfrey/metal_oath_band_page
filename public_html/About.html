<p>
Metal Oath has been around for five years now. Hank founded the band and was
</p>
<p>
solo for the first year it was in existence. He found a drummer after one year
</p>
<p>
in Anthony. They played together for two years before they found Bernard and
</p>
<p>
Radford. They now play together and make great music.
