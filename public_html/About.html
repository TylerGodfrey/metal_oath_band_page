Metal Oath has been around for close to five years now. Hank, lead vocals, founded the band and was

solo for the first year it was in existence. He found a drummer after one year in Anthony.

<p>
They played together for two years before they found their guitarists, Bernard and Radford.

They now play together and make great music for their fans to enjoy.
