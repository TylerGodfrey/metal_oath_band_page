            </li>
            
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <br>
    <li>

            </li>
            
            <li>
                Radford has been known to write his own songs during his free
                time. He often trys to persuade Hank to sing them.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                When not playing or writing songs, Radford can often be found hiking with

        </ul>

        Bernard
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bernard plays the bass guitar for Metal Oath. He has been in that
                position also for two years.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Bernard has taken the lead guitar whenever Radford gets sick and he
                does a great job.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Secretly, Bernard can't sing very well. Thankfully, the others tend to drown him out.

        Anthony
        <ul>
        
            <li>
                Anthony is the guy in the back who bangs on the drums. He has been the

            </li>
            
            <li>
                Anthony lives in an apartment building where he likes to practice his 
                drumming. Needless to say, he has been warned many
                times about his noise.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                He is the only member of the group not to have any tattoos, as he is afraid of needles. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                In high school, Anthony played percussion in his school's concert band.
