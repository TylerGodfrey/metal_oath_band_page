        Radford
        <ul>
            <li>
                Radford is the lead guitarist and has been for two years now.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Radford has been known to write his own songs during his free
                time. He often trys to persuade Hank to sing them.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                When not playing or writing songs, Radford can often be found hiking with
                his dog, Demon.

        Bernard
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bernard plays the bass guitar for Metal Oath. He has been in that
                position also for two years.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Bernard has taken the lead guitar whenever Radford gets sick and he
                does a great job.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Secretly, Bernard can't sing very well. Thankfully, the others tend to drown him out.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               At home, Bernard has a pet fish named Jerry, and a cat named Tom.

        Anthony
        <ul>
        
            <li>
                Anthony is the guy in the back who bangs on the drums. He has been the 
                drummer for four years now.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Anthony lives in an apartment building and likes to practice his 
                drumming in his apartment. Needless to say, he has been warned many
                times about his noise.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                He is the only member of the group not to have any tattoos, as he is afraid of needles. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                In high school, Anthony played percussion in his school's concert band.
