When a background color is defined, consider also defining a
foreground color (by using the "color" property). This helps
to avoid conflict with user-defined style sheets and to
improve accessibility. This message is displayed up to 5

[CSE] Message number 2 in line 9:1:
It's recommended that "*#logo" be used instead of "#logo" so
that the universal selector (*) is explicit instead of
implied. Using explicit universal selectors can decrease
confusion and improve readability. This message is displayed

[CSE] Warning number 2 in line 38:10:
Many mobile devices use touch screens making ":hover"
problematic, cumbersome, or impossible to use. Depending on
the browser, ":hover" might never match, or it might match
for brief moments, or until the user touches another
element. Ensure that content is never only accessible or
only visible by hovering. This message is displayed only
once.

classified as "other" do not belong in any one of the other

result in different typefaces from different families being

using a more specific typeface to avoid this issue (like
"lucida sans" instead of "lucida").

[CSE] Error number 1 in line 60:22:
The value for the "list-style-type" property is invalid. CSS
2.1 allows this value to be "disc", "circle", "square",
"decimal", "decimal-leading-zero", "lower-roman",
"upper-roman", "lower-greek", "lower-latin", "upper-latin",
"armenian", "georgian", "lower-alpha", "upper-alpha", or
"none". CSS3 allows this value to be "<counter-style> |
<string> | none". This property sets the appearance of the
list item marker if 'list-style-image' has the value 'none'
or is an invalid image that cannot be displayed.

[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 2:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.
